## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Desktop-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

As this is my first reactjs project i can say i learned alot from this project, i learned how to use React proper and got to practice everything i have been learning about react, the fetch api was quite interesting, and i can say I'm not really proud of the codes i write as their was lot of repetition but i do hope to learn how to do this better in my coming react projects... 

### Continued development

I would still focus on props and state managements in future projects and redux too
